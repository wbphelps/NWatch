1) make buttons consistent
   left button is always select
	 right lower is down or right
	 right upper is up or left

2) torch - both up & down buttons work

3) close current menu when going to sleep

4) add Split feature to stopwatch

5) 2 character am/pm indicator "AM" or "PM"

My TODO list:

1) quieter beep
2) add SOS to flashlight?
3) countdown timer
